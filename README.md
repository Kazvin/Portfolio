Place to hold my smaller projects

1. Match game - match two images together. If they match stay flipped. If they do not match flip them back over. Game won after all flags are flipped over. 
2. SQL Database - A relational database of a college. College_Schema_Objects creates tables with constraints to maintain data integrity. College_Schema_Data inputs data into the tables.
